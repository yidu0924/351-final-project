## 🎯 Project Overview

This project explores **remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)** technology, which enables **contactless heart rate measurement** from ordinary facial videos captured by standard cameras.

### The Challenge

Traditional heart rate monitoring requires physical contact through sensors or wearables. Our goal is to develop a **non-invasive alternative** that analyzes subtle color changes in facial skin caused by blood circulation.

### Our Approach

We combine **classical digital signal processing** techniques with **machine learning methods** to:

1. Extract physiological signals from facial videos
2. Process and filter the signals to isolate heart rate information
3. Estimate accurate heart rate measurements
4. Compare different algorithmic approaches
