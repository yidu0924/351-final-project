# EECS 351 Final Project: Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)** — estimating heart rate (HR) from ordinary facial videos without any contact sensors.

## Problem Statement
By analyzing subtle color changes in facial skin caused by blood-volume variations, we aim to recover a clean 1-D physiological waveform and compute accurate heart-rate estimates.

## Our Approach
- Classical signal-processing pipeline for rPPG extraction
- Machine-learning baseline comparison
- Comprehensive visualizations and performance analysis
